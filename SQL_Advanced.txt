Exercises
1. Find the average SurfaceArea of all countries
2.  Max Life Expectancy
3. Min GNP
4. SUM of Population from all countries
5. Surface Area Grouped by REGION
6. Count the names with indepedent year not being null

Stretch goal
Use WHERE to add more specific queries

1. SELECT AVG(SurfaceArea) FROM country;
2. SELECT MAX(LifeExpectancy) FROM country;
3. SELECT MIN(GNP) FROM country ;
4. SELECT SUM(Population) FROM country;
5. SELECT Region, CODE, SurfaceArea FROM country GROUP BY Region ORDER BY SurfaceArea;
6. SELECT COUNT(Name) FROM country WHERE IndepYear != 'Null';

STETCH GOAL:
7. SELECT Region, MIN(GNP) FROM country GROUP BY Region ORDER BY MIN(GNP);

NESTED Queries

1. SELECT MIN(SurfaceArea) FROM country;

2. SELECT Name, MIN(SurfaceArea) FROM country WHERE SurfaceArea = x

Nested query:
SELECT Name, MIN(SurfaceArea) FROM country WHERE SurfaceArea = (SELECT MIN(SurfaceArea) FROM country);
